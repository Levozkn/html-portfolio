<h1>Short Info</h1>
<p>A few years back I changed job and sectors entirely which by accident led me to work with websites, more in the Wordpress area. 
  Since then I have been curious to dive into coding and learn all of the aspects of the game and here I am taking the first few steps!</p>
  
<p>The ultimate goal is to master the craft of coding and being able to create fantastic webpages that are pretty much pre-designed in my head already. Obviously there is a long way to go 
  until we get there but patience is a virtue and its a step by step process hence no need to rush :).</p> 

 <p>Simply put - Work In Progress!</p>
